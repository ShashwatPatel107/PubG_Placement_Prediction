# PubG_Placement_Prediction
Predict Final Finish Placement of Player in Game of PubG.

## PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
This project aims to predict player placement in PUBG, the intense battle royale game. By crunching match data and deploying various machine learning algorithms, we'll unveil the key factors behind player success, build and compare predictive models, and ultimately crown the champion algorithm for accurately forecasting final rankings. Stay tuned as we navigate through data, train models, and declare the MVP in the arena of PUBG prediction!
